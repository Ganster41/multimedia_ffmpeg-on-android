"FFmpeg on Android" project is to enhance multimedia support on Android OS,
starts on 4.0 ICS version. Currently Android OS has many limits to support
variety multimedia formats, using specific H/W resources, not also S/W. So,
we expact, if we can use the famus FFmpeg library in Andorid OS with little
modification on Android Stagefright; We can overcome many current limits in
Android muntimedia supports easly.



Media Flow
----------
"FFmpeg on Android" is designed to use FFmpeg library on Android OS, and less
to modify current Android framework, Stagefright. So, "FFmpeg on Andorid"
adopt the "Flow-By-Pass" model. "Flow-By-Pass" model designs by pass multi-
media flow inside of stagefright framework for FFmpeg case. Below flow shows
how we adopt "Flow-By-Pass" model to use FFmpeg library.

 a) stagefright original flow (in case of AVI)
		file source -> aviextractor -> avisource -> omx-codec
 b) FFmpeg on Android flow
		FFmpegSource(*) -> ffextractor(*) -> ffsource(*) -> omx-codec
